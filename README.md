# SP1 Project Template

This is a template for creating an end-to-end [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) project
that can generate a proof of any RISC-V program.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/getting-started/install.html)

## Running the Project

There are three main ways to run this project: execute the program, generate a core proof, and
generate a Groth16 or PLONK proof.

### Build the Program

The program is automatically built through `script/build.rs` when the script is built.

### Execute the Program

To run the program without generating a proof:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --execute
```

This will execute the program and display the output.

### Generate a Core Proof

To generate a core proof for your program:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --prove
```

## Using the Prover Network

We highly recommend using the Succinct prover network for any non-trivial programs or benchmarking purposes. For more information, see the [setup guide](https://docs.succinct.xyz/generating-proofs/prover-network.html).

To get started, copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, set the `SP1_PROVER` environment variable to `network` and set the `SP1_PRIVATE_KEY`
environment variable to your whitelisted private key.

To generate a proof, run the following command:

```sh
SP1_PROVER=network SP1_PRIVATE_KEY=... cargo run --release
```
